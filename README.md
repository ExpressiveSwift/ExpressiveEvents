Swift µ-framework implementing fast and idiomatic events (an alternative to NSNotificationCenter), plus idiomatic NSNotificationCenter subscriptions and KVO.

Part of [ExpressiveSwift](https://github.com/ExpressiveSwift/ExpressiveSwift), a collection of µ-frameworks solving specific problems with straightforward, concise, readable and safe code.

**Development status**: do not use, unless you're ready to join the development effort.

<!-- **Alpha status**: (1) seems to work, (2) is successfully used by an app under development, (3) can be adopted if you don't mind digging into and debugging the code of the framework occasionally, (4) may undergo radical changes. -->
